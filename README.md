# Geotagging-using-python-and-python-libraries-like-geopy
This algorithm is run on an on board computer of a UAV (like Rasberry Pi or jetson nano) to tag selected/detected objects with their latitude and longitude.

The video which i used is provided in the same directory as the code. Press 'p' to pause the video and click and drag to make a box around the object you wish to tag with it's latitude and longitude.

Also specify the horizontal and vertical field of views in the call function. The tests were performed using a Git2P camera mounted on a UAV flying at the height of 40 meters. So keep in mind to provide any parameters that are changed as arguments to the call function.
